         <p>The airport in Jackson Hole, WY is directly next to the Teton Mountain Range. 
            Usually this is a great view but the wildfires in California obscured the view.

         <p>The next day we went out for our first hike around Jenny Lake.

         <p> This is me sitting on a bear. 
            We did not see a real bear on our trip but a women in the airport "traded" me her picture of a bear for a picture I had of a moose.

         <p> The vest I am wearing in this picture was bought for this trip and never worn again after the trip. 
            I sometimes put it on and then decide not to wear it. I dont understand vest.
